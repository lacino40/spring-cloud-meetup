      # The 'app-id' is a code that is generated by www.OpenWeatherMap.com site when a user subscribes to their services.

      # Once you have subscribed and the API key is generated, you should insert it here in the given field,
      # or you can also provide it as a parameter when launching the application through the start command (-Dservice.weather.open-weather.api-key=<your api key>

      # If no API key is provided, the application will use mocked data
      api-key:
      # The mock-file-path property is a fail-safe mechanism utilized in the application in case the API key is not
